# Smart-Home-with-database-login
Smart lock system designed using Arduino and Firebase

### Electronics needed:
* Arduino Nano
* Bluetooth Module
* 90g Servo
* 5v Wall Adapter

### Application used: 
To lock and unlock the door we need a device running either android or windows with bluetooth builtin.
To install on Android you will need to go to the play store and download and app called Bluetooth Terminal and for windows its called TeraTerm next we need to
connect the hc-05 to our phone it should be called linvor and the password will be either 0000 or 1234. Once its paired open the app we just installed, click on options
and tap connect to device (insecure) now our phone is basically simulating the arduino serial monitor which means we can see and send information coming from
the arduino.
